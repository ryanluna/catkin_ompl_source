This package provides a shell for building OMPL from source in a catkin environment.  You (yes, you) must do two things before this will work:

1) Download the source of OMPL.  Whatever version you want.
2) Copy the source into this directory.  You don't need everything.
At a minimum, copy these directories from the OMPL source into this folder:
   - CMakeModules
   - src
